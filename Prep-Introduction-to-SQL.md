## a) Prep: Introduction to SQL

In this course, I learned how to interact with an existing database. It begins with an introduction to the various components of an SQL query and then moves on to show how to alter a table (or schema) and create new tables from scratch. I learned a concept and performed an interactive exercise in each lesson. With this course, I have gained a solid foundation for using SQL in my own projects and for my future endeavors.
