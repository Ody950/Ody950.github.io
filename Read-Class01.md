<div>&nbsp;&emsp;</div>

### ***why this topic matters as it relates to what iam studying in this module?***
<div>&nbsp;&emsp;</div>

- This topic is significant to me because it teaches me how to track and check methods. It is something I will use permanently and daily during my studies
<div>&nbsp;&emsp;</div>

### ***Name one major benefit of being able to trace the call stack.***

- If there is a one major benefit it will be Debugging, Because nothing will hold you back like error from continuing the work, it will help to see which methods were called and in what order, and this will be helpful.

## ***Try/Catch Blocks***

### ***why this topic matters as it relates to what iam studying in this module?***

- Of course, this topic is of importance to me, as it is essential in the code I will write, otherwise there will be many errors. In this class, there is a lab to make a simple calculator in which we will use these commands extensively.
<div>&nbsp;&emsp;</div>

### ***If you could use try/catch in your day to day life, name an exception you’d like to ‘catch’ and handle.***

- I can use try/catch to process the decisions that I make daily, as I want to reduce the decisions that I take with excessive enthusiasm or anger. This can save me from many losses due to these decisions.
<div>&nbsp;&emsp;</div>


### ***From an efficiency standpoint, are there downsides to try/catch blocks?***

- I think this kind of code can reduce the speed of the process.
<div>&nbsp;&emsp;</div>

## ***Exception Handling***

### ***Describe how you explain the .Net approach to exception handling to a non technical friend.***

- I can simplify the issue for him, as we can imagine a school bus driver picking up students in order according to their areas of residence, but while doing his work, one of the students was sick, and in this case he does not stop and return to school, but continues, and the sick student is considered an exception.

## ***Case Studies: Therac-25 and Ariane 5***
<div>&nbsp;&emsp;</div>

### ***Name glaring mistakes that were made during the production of these systems.***

<div>&nbsp;&emsp;</div>

- There was a software error in the manufacture of a computer used to work with radiation therapy machines, since the code was not subject to standards.

- The second error was also a software error that caused the missile to be destroyed, as the error was related to the missile's launch speed.
