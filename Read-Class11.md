# Introduction to Databases and ERDs



## why this topic matters as it relates to what Iam studying in this module?

This topic is important not just for the C# language or .Net core but  its important for any programming language, becouse the accessing data from a database are an essential part of this programming language. At runtime, at design time, this data is important to the application. .NET developers will also benefit from gaining experience with database systems, given how important it is to store and manage data effectively today.And when we speak about databases, we should speek about Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), which are crucial for modeling data stored in a database. It visualizes the relationships between entities in a database. Therefore, it helps us understand the relationships between tables in a database, which is important when writing code.  


# Database Schema


## What is a Schema?
Data schemas represent the logical view of a database. where displayed database objects as tables, functions, and relations. It defines how the data is organized and how the relations among them are associated, A database schema includes descriptive details of the database that can be depicted through schema diagrams.


## Why do we use them?

Schemas allow interpreting a vast amount of information quickly. it will can make the best use of the organization's data by eliminate data redundancy, prevent data inconsistencies, facilitate data retrieval and analysis, ensure the integrity of the data, and keep it safe from unauthorized access.

## What do they look like?
Schemas are blueprints that describe the layout and organization of the data contained in a database, like what kinds of fields are present. Each column in a table has a name and a data type, and all data entries and objects in the database have unique keys. it will include Consistent formatting for all data entries, unique keys for all entries and database objects, each column in a table has a name and data type




 # Database Keys

## What are the different types of Database Keys?

- Candidate Key.
- Primary Key.
- Foreign Key.
- Super Key.
- Alternate Key.
- Composite Key.
- Unique Key.

## What is a Primary Key?

the key constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table, and it is  must contain unique values, and cannot contain null values. also the  table can have only one primary key,and in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns .


## What is a Foreign Key?

Foreign Key in DBMS is different from a super key, candidate key or primary key. This is because a foreign key is used to link two tables together or create connectivity between the two. This is because it references another table's primary key.


## What is a Composite Key?
Two or more attributes together form a composite key that can uniquely identify a tuple in a table. even though a single column canâ€™t identify any row uniquely, a combination of over one column can uniquely identify any record.


## How are they different? When do you use 1 over the others?
They are all very different, as each key has a function it performs. There is no repetition between these keys in tasks, and I explained the function of each key next to its definition above

# relational database

## What are Relationships in a relational database?
The concept of database relationships refers to associations between tables generated by joining statements. when one table has a foreign key that references the primary key of the other table. and it allow relational databases to split and store data in different tables.


## What is a 1:1 relationship?
By creating this relationship, a row from one table can only be related to one and only one record from another table. It is also possible for any row of a second table to be related to any row of the first table.


## What is a Many:Many relationship?
Creating a relationship between two tables. It is possible for each record of the first table to be related to more than one record  in the second table. Similarly, it is also possible for any record of the second table to relate to more than one record of the first table.relational database systems usually don't allow us to implement a direct many-to-many relationship between two tables.


## How about a 1: Many or a Many:1?

 By creating this relationship, any single rows of the first table can be related to one or more rows of the second tables, but the rows of second tables can only relate to the only row in the first table.
