# ***Data Structures and Algorithms***


## ***Why Does This Topic Matter?***

- As a new programmer in this field, I think learning algorithms will help me write better code, solve problems more efficiently and create code easier to read and understand. Additionally, it will be important in software engineering interviews. Many companies ask questions about algorithms during interviews to test problem-solving skills.but when im write the code  i will use algorithms to sort data, search for data, and perform other tasks. 

- For this course, the Data structures  will be  help me to store and retrieve data more efficiently and write code that is easier to read and understand. And in this course I can use built-in data structures like arrays, lists, and dictionaries to store and organize data.


## ***What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?***

- If there is one thing that will be the more important things it will be the big O, which is the time complexity, and if i need to decide which data structure is best i will check every time complexity for it, and as you know the Time complexity is a measure of how long an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input.  




## ***How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?***

- In the prep course when i use the Recursion on fibonacci there is a if statement, it will avoid an infinite recursive call stack. This does not make a recursive call, where the branches without recursive calls are called base cases, and branches with recursive calls are called recursive cases.
