## why this topic matters as it relates to what Iam studying in this module?

For us as .NET developers, SendGrid offers an Email API that can be used to send both marketing and transactional emails. It provides a straightforward way to send emails using the Twilio SendGrid Mail Send API and C#.



## Summary


## Create a Twilio SendGrid account

Select Marketplace from the Azure portal's home page. When you click on More services, you will be able to search for the Marketplace icon.

Among the services offered by the Azure Marketplace is Twilio SendGrid, an email service provided by Twilio. You can find it by searching for "Twilio SendGrid." You will also find it under Software as a Service (SaaS)

## Twilio SendGrid account setup

To send your first email, you will need to complete the following Twilio SendGrid account setup steps. The following requirements help ensure that your account remains secure and that your messages do not end up in the spam folder.

Configure Two-factor authentication

Create an API key

Complete Sender Authentication

## Two-factor authentication

In order to ensure the security of your account, Twilio SendGrid uses two-factor authentication (2FA). To enable 2FA, Navigate to Two-Factor Authentication in the Twilio SendGrid Settings menu, and click Add Two-Factor Authentication.

## API keys

With API Keys, you can authenticate your application, mail client, or website with Twilio SendGrid services. API keys are tailored to provide access to only the services you select, as opposed to a username and password. In addition, you are able to delete and create API keys without affecting your other account credentials. It is for these reasons that Twilio SendGrid requires that you use API keys to access its services.

Twilio SendGrid provides three types of API key:

Full Access

Restricted Access

Billing Access

In order to ensure the security of your account, you should grant each key the least amount of privilege necessary. When you create a Restricted Access key, you are able to select a subset of all the possible permissions for the key.

## Sender Authentication

Twilio SendGrid requires customers to complete Sender Authentication. This requirement protects your domain's reputation as an email sender and helps uphold legitimate sending behavior by Twilio SendGrid customers.
