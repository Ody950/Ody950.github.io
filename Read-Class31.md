# Razor Pages

## why this topic matters as it relates to what Iam studying in this module?

It is recommended that we use Razor Pages as .NET developers because it simplifies and streamlines the development process of web applications. Because of the convention-based structure, the code-behind model, and the integrated support for common operations such as CRUD, it makes it possible to quickly create web applications while maintaining code organization. Additionally, Razor Pages seamlessly integrate with ASP.NET Core features, offer good community support, and are highly performant, which makes it a valuable option for projects requiring productivity, efficiency, and efficiency in development.  


## Summary


This is a new feature of ASP.NET Core MVC that facilitates the development of page-based scenarios.

As a markup language, Razor transcends Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and C# and Visual Basic syntax, though C# is the most commonly employed language. A Razor file extension will appear as .cshtml, .vbhtml, or .razor when viewed in an ASP.NET solution. Razor's compiled artifacts are executable codes that write HTML to the HTTP response. As a result of the compilation of Razor, performance in production scenarios has been improved.


### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge Asp. Core
- C#
- Html
- CSS


### Create a Razor Pages Web App:

- Select ASP.NET Core Web App in the Create a new project dialog box.

- Enter RazorPagesMovie as the name of the project in the Configure your new project dialog box. The project name should be RazorPagesMovie, including the capitalization, so the namespaces will match when you copy and paste example code.

- Click on Next.

### Advantages of Razor Pages

- You will find it easy to learn.

- Because it supports cross-platform deployment, it can be used on Windows, Unix, and Mac operating systems.  

- The Razor markup language can be used in conjunction with the C# programming language.

- Coding behind the page is more organized than web forms in ASP.NET.

- You can build any application with this lightweight and flexible framework.
