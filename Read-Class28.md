## why this topic matters as it relates to what Iam studying in this module?

In most cases, we use it for managing sessions, which is essential for maintaining a user's state across multiple requests. We often use cookies in .NET to store authentication tokens, manage sessions, and track user preferences.

## Summary

The HTTP cookie consists of a small piece of data that is stored in the user's browser. In the world of software, HTTP cookies play an important role. Cookies can be used for storing information related to users and for a variety of other purposes. Asp.net core provides an easy way to work with cookies. ASP.NET allows us to access cookies using httpcontext.current, while ASP.NET Core does not offer HTTPcontext.currently. There is no coupling and no modularity in ASP.NET Core. The request object has access to the HTTP context through the IHttpContextAccessor interface that resides under the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http namespace. This interface can be accessed at any point in the application by using the IHttpContextAccessor interface.

The term 'cookie' refers to a small text file that is stored by the browser on the machine of the user. A cookie is a plain text file; it does not contain any executable code. Web pages or servers instruct browsers to store this information and then return it with each subsequent request in accordance with a set of rules. It is possible for web servers to identify individual users based on this information. A cookie is usually set by most sites requiring a login once your credentials have been verified, and you are then free to navigate to all parts of the site provided the cookie is present and valid. It is important to remember that cookies contain only data and are not harmful in themselves.
