## why this topic matters as it relates to what Iam studying in this module?
As an all-in-one solution, it can streamline the work-life of a .NET developer. Azure DevOps allows use to create one free Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery target using either a GitHub repository or an Azure repository.   


## Summary

DevOps is typically a collaborative effort between the development and operations teams. This model facilitates the exchange of information between these two teams in order to ensure that the project can be developed effectively and without errors. As a result, this industry practice also involves the automation and integration of both teams' development processes.

As part of the DevOps approach, certain rules and practices are in place in order to influence the development and deployment of projects. From startups to large enterprises, DevOps is changing the way businesses are built and operated.





# MVC Basics


## why this topic matters as it relates to what Iam studying in this module?
Learning MVC basics can make us as  .NET developers able to build scalable, maintainable, and testable web applications that are easy to maintain and extend, because the  MVC is the foundation of many .NET web frameworks.



## Summary

ASP.NET MVC is an open-source software from Microsoft. Its web development framework combines the features of MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, the most up-to-date ideas and techniques from Agile development and the best parts of the existing ASP.NET platform.

- In MVC the View only deals with the UI and user actions are defined in Controller.
- MVC is action based architecture, which helps keep code clean and organized. Based on an action, a certain view is displayed.
- In MVC, we don't have View State to store the state information.
- In MVC action logic and UI are loosely coupled. Because of these they can be tested easily.


With MVC, the application is designed as a three-layered system, namely Model, View, and Controller

1- The model layer represents the objects in our application. A model is also a class that contains all the objects and their properties and methods.

2- View Layer has all the html controls which define the UI of the application. Here in MVC, we don’t have drag and drop option for controls as we don’t use server controls. Instead we use Razor Engine available with Visual Studio by default which helps in rendering the View.

3- Controller basically handles the request from user. It is the heart of the MVC application as everyone say. It is responsible to handle the request and return a response to user by loading appropriate View with data from Model.




# Tag Helpers

## why this topic matters as it relates to what Iam studying in this module?

By using Tag Helpers in Razor files, server-side code may participate in the creation and rendering of HTML elements. 

## Summary


Razor files are used to generate and render the HTML necessary to display the requested page in the browser. There are two kinds of files with the .cshtml extension: those containing client-side code and those containing server-side code. As a result of the execution of this code, HTML will be sent to the browser.

 Razor files have two unique features. The first is that they use razor syntax, which allows developers to insert C# code inside HTML. The second feature, which is the focus of this blog post, is the use of tag helpers. Tag helpers allow server-side C# code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in razor files. This feature makes razor files more readable and easier to code, as it reduces the need for explicit transitions between HTML and C# in Razor views. Additionally, tag helpers provide an HTML-friendly development experience and a rich IntelliSense environment for creating HTML and Razor markup.




# Bootstrap

## why this topic matters as it relates to what Iam studying in this module?

because Bootstrap have a responsive design, which adjusts to desktops, tablets, and mobiles. This feature makes it easy for us as .Net developers to create websites that look great on any device. Moreover, Bootstrap provides a range of beautiful and functional built-in components that are easy to customize. This makes it easy for us to create websites that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional.

## Summary

Bootstrap is a widely-used front-end framework that has gained popularity in recent times. It is a mobile-first framework that provides a range of features such as sleek design, intuitive interface, and powerful functionality to help developers build responsive websites quickly and easily. Bootstrap is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
