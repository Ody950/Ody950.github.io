# Interfaces


## why this topic matters as it relates to what iam studying in this module?

Interfaces is an essential element of C#, because C# doesn't support multiple inheritance of classes, making Interfaces is a contributor to software development processes using this language, where including behavior from multiple sources in a class is not possible.

## Summary 

The problem was that the class could only inherit from one class. We need to find a solution that enables us to implement multiple base classes into the class. The Interfaces solve to use this problem, and Interfaces look like the class in every thing but  interface only has a definition it cant have an implementation but it can implemented via a class.




# Back to Basics
## Summary 

This article discusses the importance of implementing and using, and whether they are truly interconnected or can be separated, and if the separation is beneficial. According to the article, Interface allows us to interact with objects based on what they do rather than how. In an easier way. We can define methods in an interface and implement them in a class. This is not only for one class, but it can be for more. This is because it works on the principle of contracting, and each class has its own contract.

## Summary

Here in this article there is more accurate information about the mechanism for executing the interface  and how to use it, where the interface can be a member of a namespace or a class and can contain declarations of methods, properties, indexers, and events. But as I mentioned earlier signatures without any implementation. and it declare static abstract and static virtual members for all member types except fields, and it don’t have a runtime dispatch mechanism analogous to virtual or abstract methods declared in classes. Instead, the compiler uses type information available at compile time. about interface inheritance, they can’t contain instance state but can contain static fields and the interface can inherit from one or more base interfaces. and about explicitly to the implemented member can’t be accessed through a class instance but only through an instance of the interface.
