## why this topic matters as it relates to what Iam studying in this module?

JAM stack solutions can be implemented by ASP.NET developers without generating HTML. It's possible for use to streamline form submissions, content gating, security, or even expose internal systems to the public. Even though ASP.NET Core Razor Pages don't strictly follow JAM stack principles, for us as .NET developers can use them. Whether HTML code is generated statically or dynamically, JAM stack technologies can be utilized.  




## JAM Stack

 Using JavaScript, reusable APIs, and pre-built markup, the JAMstack is a modern web development platform.




## Benefits of JAMstack:

1. Security: Less servers need to be hardened against attacks, read-only hosting, and dedicated security teams for specific systems.

2. Performance: Increased page loading speeds with no need for costly or complex infrastructure.

3. Maintainability: Less complicated hosting, simpler maintenance tasks, and a more stable generated site.

4. Portability: Compatible with a variety of hosting services and a simple static hosting solution.

5. Developer Experience: No proprietary technologies or exotic frameworks were used, based on widely available tools and conventions.


The JAMstack architectural approach decouples the web experience layer from the data and business logic layers. Using APIs, custom logic and third-party services can be accessed via a composable web architecture. There are several key features of JAMstack apps, including distributed architectures and static sites. Due to the distributed architecture of JAMstack apps, content is served from a global network of servers, resulting in faster load times and better scalability. A static website consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are ready-to-use and require no server-side processing.
