## ***Introduction*** 

I am *Odai Al-Obeidat*, I graduated with a ba*ch*elor's degree in ***civil engineering*** in 2017. In the following years, I studied a Ma**st**er's degree in ***Business Administration***, which I completed last year. Over the past few years, I have worked for a number of companies specializing in logistics services.I was rejected both times. To me, this course serves as a gateway to the administrative side of the field.

Documentation is one of the most important components of my study project. During this study, it will serve as a milestone for demonstrating my knowledge improvement as well as documenting my new learnings and highlighting them.
