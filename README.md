# Reading Notes

## ***Introduction*** 

I am *Odai Al-Obeidat*, I graduated with a ba*ch*elor's degree in ***civil engineering*** in 2017. In the following years, I studied a Ma**st**er's degree in ***Business Administration***, which I completed last year. Over the past few years, I have worked for a number of companies specializing in logistics services.I was rejected both times. To me, this course serves as a gateway to the administrative side of the field.

Documentation is one of the most important components of my study project. During this study, it will serve as a milestone for demonstrating my knowledge improvement as well as documenting my new learnings and highlighting them.


## ***Code 401 - Advanced Software Development***

# 1-Prework - Part 1

## a) Prep: DSA Practice
- I have watched the first 12 tutorials of the Microsoft Virtual Academy C# Fundamentals and applied all the work that has been done on them, and this image indicates the result, This gave me a good understanding of C# and Visual Studio.

- I have completed reading and applying in .NET in the browser, This gave me a good understanding of C#.
   - In Browser Tutorial

   - Numbers in C#

   - Branches and Loops

## b) Prep: Computer Setup
- Done Windows OS is required
- Setup the Visual Studio Community Version and install .NET Core SDK.

## b) Prep: Read C# History
- A fter i study History of .NET and C#, Tooling and C# Language, i come up with this 5 points explain what you learned.

  1-The C# team is continuing to innovate and add new features, from (C# 1.0) 2002 up to (C# 11) 2022, where C# version 11 introduces generic math and several features that support that goal.


  2-It took me more than two hours to understand managed code and CLR, where CLR is part of the dot net framework it, it provides a layer of abstraction between a process running in memory and an application that runs inside that process, the CLR is like a real live translator between your source code and the operating system.


  3- C# is a managed language the code is managed by the CLR before it is executed, on the other the Unmanaged code is code that is executed outside the .NET runtime environment.


  4- we can avoid the new expression and the array type when you initialize an array on declaration, i think this will be save the time


  5- A jagged array is an array whose elements are arrays, possibly of different sizes.
