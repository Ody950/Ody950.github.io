# Inheritance


## why this topic matters as it relates to what iam studying in this module?

Inheritance is part of object-oriented programming and one of the basic components of .NET. It is critical for organizing code and dividing large problems into small parts. It enables you to reuse your code in more than one location to achieve high benefits. As for inheritance, it works well in .NET, as it allows me to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in previous classes, which means there is less redundancy in the code we write.

## Summary 

The basic function of Inheritance is to pass the behavior from one class to another, where the class that gives the behavior is the parent and the class that inherits the behavior is the children, it inherits all the members (fields, properties and methods). This behavior can be modified or added to in children.And the main benefit of all of this is to make the code we write less in the number of lines and more professional.



# Abstract

## why this topic matters as it relates to what iam studying in this module?


Abstract is important to me in the specialization I am currently studying, as it facilitates teamwork, especially in projects worked on by more than one programmer, as it avoids a lot of complexity that may be an additional load on programmers and may cause errors and waste of time.

## Summary 

 Abstract makes us able to create classes with details hidden from the user or other programmer, so that he can only use what he is allowed to do, which is called interface and prevent him from accessing implementations so that this does not cause programming problems as a result of accessing unrelated code or certain people's work. The closest example is a car. You do not have to know the mechanics of how the car works to drive it. You just have to learn to drive to use a car. There are lots of benefits to using abstract including the reduction of code complexity, and it also makes refactoring very easy.



# Polymorphism

## why this topic matters as it relates to what iam studying in this module?

This topic is useful for C# programmers, as a language such as C#, which is characterized by polymorphism, allows developers to access objects of different types through the same interface, making it easier to call objects that perform the same function with minor differences without different name.

## Summary 

Polymorphism is complementary to Inheritance, as it enables us to send behavior from parents to children with the possibility of modification, as this is done through two methods 

### 1- ***overview***: If this property is generic and I want to use it a little differently in children.

***Vehicle*** 
- vehicleDetails()
- "This is a vehicle"

***Car***
- vehicleDetails()
- "This is a car"

### 2- ***overloading*** : The parameter can be different or the data type can be different.

- Sum (int x, int y):
return x + y 

- Sum (int x, int y, int z):
 return x + y + z

- Sum (float x, float y, float z):
return x + y 



# OOP Principles

## why this topic matters as it relates to what iam studying in this module?

That OOP is a basic thing in programming today and is critical for all programming languages, as the programs worked on by programmer in most companies require the use of such methods to produce these programs at this level of complexity.

## Summary 


The OOP is related to the great development of the requirements of the programs being worked on at the present time, as they require that a group of variables be combined in struct, where we call this package an object or a class that can include more than one object, and which enables us to store data of different types. We also enable us to make function in it as well, and the OOP is divided into four sections, of which we mentioned three at the top, and it remains Encapsulation, which is simply a collection of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, such as a class, which protects this data from unauthorized modification Authorized, where access to data is guaranteed only through available methods.
