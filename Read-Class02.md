# ***a) Unit Testing Best Practices***


## why this topic matters as it relates to what iam studying in this module?

- I believe that Unit Testing is directly and greatly helpful for what I am currently studying, especially since I am a beginner, as it will enable me to write high-quality code and fix errors faster. Which makes me get closer to being a professional in programming faster, especially since these topics are sensitive.

## Name 3 ways in which Unit Testing improves your codebase and productivity


- The most crucial point in these three ways is the quality of the code. This is because we write modular code that is easier to maintain and modify. This gives us higher code quality.

- Unit testing allows us to isolate bugs in the codebase, and we can make sure recent modifications to the code didn't cause problems. This allows us to identify and fix the bugs before they become more serious issues. This will save us time and money in the long run by reducing the cost of fixing bugs later in the development cycle.

- about productivity, i think it will be affected by the two points mentioned above, but i see productivity can be affected by time and Unit testing helps us to save time by reducing the amount of time spent debugging and fixing issues.

## How would you write a unit test for a household task such as putting away laundry


- I think the household is more than one tasks. This requires you to divide it into small tasks each of which should do only one thing, after that you should write a code to do this task after that you must add a new project name (Unit Test Project Template) and write the testing code after that you click Ctrl-R, T to run it.

## Things I want to know more about

# ***b) Art of Readme and ReadMe Best Practices***


## why this topic matters as it relates to what iam studying in this module?

- I think that this topic is important to me in my specialty, as it can be used in the work of the document in a professional manner.
<div>&nbsp;&emsp;</div>

## Name 3 reasons a quality README is just as important as quality code.

- in README the quality is very important, since it will be the starting point for the user, this means it must be fairly brief but detailed. To explain and showcase what your application does.

- Provides useful information about running, testing, and contributing to your application if the methods it contains are comprehensive and complete.

- A number of people are allowed to clarify some programming issues as a form of contribution and documentation.

##  When writing a README for your co-developers, name 4 crucial elements to include.


- The title should be clear and describe the content accurately and concisely at the same time

- A brief and clear description of the project or program, which quickly explains most things

- One of the most significant things is the installation and method in a detailed and accurate manner. I think it should be error-free.

- Finally, the use method must be explained
