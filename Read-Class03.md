# ***Readings: File Manipulation / System.IO***


# ***a) File and Stream I/O***


## why this topic matters as it relates to what iam studying in this module?

- Dealing with data in any way is essential for any programmer, whether it is in .NET or another language. This topic is important in dealing with external data sources, whether it is from a file, from the network, or other types that have been viewed. Not Just write the data and read it, but you must be familiar with the way the data is transferred and understand the mechanism through the stream and use it in bytes.

## ***Summarize and explain***

- I will briefly summarize the topic in a simple way, that the file is a collection of data stored on a disk with a specific name and a directory path. When a file is opened for reading or writing, it becomes a stream. The stream is basically the sequence of bytes passing through the communication path. And we have two main streams, input and output. And we  as C# user we want to access these files to transfer data to them or take data from them. And in .NET we use System.IO to read and write to files.

## ***Summarize and explain***

- If you want to understand this topic in a simple way, you should understand the mechanism of action only, where is StreamReader is a helper class for reading characters from a Stream by converting bytes into characters using an encoded value. And the StreamWriter is a helper class for writing a string to a Stream by converting characters into bytes. Regarding the use of these two concepts in the code, there are many details to consider like synchronously and asynchronously.
